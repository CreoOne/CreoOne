# Lingering obvious

## In the back of your head

We somehow all know this very feeling of knowing the exactly what specific piece of information we need right now,
but for some weird reason, even when it feels close, it remains unavailable for a moment longer that we'd wish.
Maybe some neighboring thought or specific mindful replay of exact path we took in our head before,
may make the "connection" that was needed to finally reach the eureka moment.
Like a switch flipped, infantile and grotesque concept of lightbulb getting instantly lit,
is closer to our experience than we would like.

## Future-susceptible

Perfection of always remembering the exact thing we need, like a computer,
is going to be the goal for next generations as it was for previous and is for present.
You may be tempted to think that it is no longer the case as we rely more and more on the computers,
slowly making them smaller and closer to our brains.

... as long as the all-faulty greed-driven jungle architectures get directed by incompetent and ignorant.

Let me get back to the topic.

## Stroke of genius

Back when programming was colorful adventure more than painful struggle it is now (see Dunningâ€“Kruger),
there where the absolute moments of finding almost perfect solutions to the problem on the daily basis.
One could think that newly obtained ability to solve complex problems without much struggle will be
the main theme of Nobel prize for years to come, just to find out that some Noble Sir
vandalized local infrastructure with the exact discovery in mid 1840, almost 170 years earlier.

## Deemed to repeat

There is infinite wisdom in knowingly reinventing the wheel.
It is painful and disappointing almost constantly, but it's not about the goal, or rather the goal is to struggle.
Exactly like glorified athlete exercising iron-will to reach impossible, or like Sisyphus being sentenced to do the same.
Burning fire of deliberate mindful repeated failure is the exact mechanism that moves you closer towards perfection.
Isn't it obvious that buddhist monk would meditate to reach "enlightenment" struggling to keep his mind free of earthly desires every day.
Isn't it obvious that scientist would explore all known and un-known dead-ends just to reach the "light-bulb moment".
