# Macrostructura 00 - Prologue

## Introduction

Through the years i've seen and read many approaches to make perfect software. While everyone's definition of perfect is different from one another, there is that implicit silent consensus in large scale, object oriented, open source world. It would seem like everyone goes into exactly the same destination, from very different origins and by refactorings arrive where everyone else also reached. Still i have not seen a single guide into archiving this destination with as little work as possible. There are bits and pieces scattered across the web, there is a vast knowledge frozen in the depths of public repositories, there is endless hours of video and text tutorials. All this needs to be searched, learned, understood bit by bit.

> If i only could extract this end destination experience for everyone to enjoy.

Thats exactly how idea for Macrostructura was born. Somehow software design patterns and architectural patterns formed, but layer in between and around those - did not. No easy walk-through for You.

This is what im hoping to archive in here, although don't expect this knowledge to be complete. This is only a frame for you to explore. To inspire and lunch into the end goal.

> From smallest concept to largest, one at the time.

## Universality

Whatever will be described in next chapters in not without it's limitations. Of course i need to restrain myself only to one niche of software development, being object oriented, declarative, almost entirely strongly static typed, classical approach. That is what i know best, that is what i use. Code examples in C#, but i don't see how that would limit you in using this in other somewhat similar languages.

Word of warning, what is wrote until this very line seems like an overpromise, but i'll try my best to fulfill it. Which in the end may not be possible, or at least end up being remarkably difficult.
